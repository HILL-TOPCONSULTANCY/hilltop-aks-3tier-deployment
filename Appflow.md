The communication flow between the **frontend**, **backend**, and **MongoDB** services in your Kubernetes environment can be understood through the interactions facilitated by both deployments and services (svc). Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Frontend Deployment and Service**:
   - **Frontend Deployment**:
     - A single replica of the `frontend` pod is created using the `frontend` image (`origenai/cloud-engineer-test-sample-app-frontend:1.0.0`).
     - The pod listens on port **3000**.
     - There are no specific environment variables or volumes mounted, indicating this is likely a stateless frontend application.

   - **Frontend Service**:
     - The service type is `LoadBalancer`, meaning it exposes the frontend application to the internet.
     - The external IP for the load balancer is **135.236.35.238**, and it listens on port **3000**, which forwards traffic to the pod on the same port.
     - The frontend interacts with the backend by making HTTP requests to the backend's service.

### 2. **Backend Deployment and Service**:
   - **Backend Deployment**:
     - A single replica of the `backend-backend` pod is created using the `backend` image (`origenai/cloud-engineer-test-sample-app-backend:1.0.0`).
     - The backend listens on port **3001**.
     - The backend container is configured with an important environment variable `MONGO_URL`, which specifies the connection string to MongoDB. This connection string is: `mongodb://username:password@mongo-svc:27017/mydb`, where `mongo-svc` is a placeholder for the MongoDB service.

   - **Backend Service**:
     - The service type is `ClusterIP`, meaning it exposes the backend service only within the cluster.
     - The backend service listens on port **3001** and forwards traffic to the pod on the same port.
     - The frontend communicates with the backend by sending HTTP requests to the backend service (`backend-backend`) using the internal cluster IP **10.1.48.110** or through Kubernetes DNS (`backend-backend.azure.svc.cluster.local`).

### 3. **MongoDB StatefulSet and Service**:
   - **MongoDB StatefulSet**:
     - A single replica of the `mongodb` pod is created using the `mongo:4.4` image.
     - The pod listens on port **27017**, the default MongoDB port.
     - The database stores data in a persistent volume (`mongodb-data`) with a capacity of **10Gi**, allowing it to maintain data across pod restarts.
     - The environment variables `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD` are retrieved from a Kubernetes secret (`mongodb-secret`), ensuring secure authentication.

   - **MongoDB Service**:
     - The service type is `ClusterIP`, meaning it is only accessible within the cluster.
     - It has no external IP and listens on port **27017**.
     - The backend pod connects to MongoDB through this service using the endpoint IP **10.0.1.9:27017**, or by the service name `mongo.azure.svc.cluster.local`.

### **Communication Flow**:
1. **User Interaction (Frontend)**:
   - A user accesses the frontend application via the external IP **135.236.35.238** on port **3000** through the internet. This is facilitated by the `frontend` service of type `LoadBalancer`.

2. **Frontend to Backend**:
   - When a request is made from the frontend that requires backend logic (e.g., fetching data from the database), the frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend service (`backend-backend`).
   - The frontend connects to the backend through the internal cluster IP **10.1.48.110**, or via Kubernetes DNS (`backend-backend.azure.svc.cluster.local`), on port **3001**.

3. **Backend to MongoDB**:
   - The backend processes the request and communicates with MongoDB using the `MONGO_URL` environment variable.
   - The backend connects to MongoDB through the internal `mongo` service (`mongo.azure.svc.cluster.local`), which resolves to IP **10.0.1.9** on port **27017**.
   - It authenticates using the credentials provided in the `MONGO_URL` and fetches or writes data to the database.

4. **Response Flow**:
   - MongoDB responds to the backend's query (data retrieval, insertion, etc.).
   - The backend then processes this response and sends it back to the frontend.
   - The frontend renders the response to the user via the browser or client application.

### **Summary**:
- **Frontend Service** (`LoadBalancer` type) exposes the frontend to the internet.
- **Backend Service** (`ClusterIP` type) allows the frontend to communicate with the backend internally in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **MongoDB Service** (`ClusterIP` type) provides the backend with access to the MongoDB database.
